= Everything You Never Wanted to Know About Spring Boot 3 AOT

Hi, Spring fans! Spring Boot 3 is here, and it's amazing! If you want to know the broad strokes of Spring Framework 6 includes, check https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUm5WZjh8RA[out this Spring Tips video] for a quick rundown. In this text, however, I want to look at the details of the brand-new ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation engine in Spring Boot 3.

Spring Boot 3's AOT engine introduces a new component model designed to provide extra information about a Spring application to support optimizing the application both on the JRE and in a GraalVM native image context. For the 80% case, you shouldn't worry about a thing. But, sometimes, you may need to intervene to get the best results. This text aims to introduce the engine, its happy-path usage, and the corner-case use.

Why would you need to intervene? What could go wrong? GraalVM native image compilation, that's what. GraalVM's native image compilation produces lightning-quick and super memory-efficient binaries. The caveat is that to achieve this magic trick, GraalVM's native image compiler needs to know when you do certain things, like reflection, proxies, JNI, serialization, etc. So somebody has to provide that configuration.

The GraalVM native image compiler needs this configuration specified either as command line switches or as `.json` configuration files present on the classpath - `META-INF/native-image/{reflect,jni,resource,proxy,etc.}-config.json`. Ideally, each library will ship its configuration. For example, Apache Tomcat, Netty, etc., need to support their use by furnishing this configuration. But what about your code, written with Spring Framework? Spring (and Java, writ large) do many dynamic things with user-provided types that they need to account for with configuration, or the GraalVM compilation will fail.

In this release, we've introduced a whole new engine - the Spring AOT engine - to make it possible to take your existing Spring Boot applications, upgrade them to Spring Boot 3, and then enjoy the incredible benefits of GraalVM native image compilation. That's the dream, anyway, and we're essentially there already. This text will look at the new AOT engine, GraalVM, and the increasingly rarer corner cases requiring some intervention.

== Introduction

I find it helpful to understand where we were to appreciate where we are now. Traditional Spring applications have _phases_ that they go through when they run. Here's a simplified understanding of what's happening in your standard Spring application:

=== Ingest

The Spring application starts up and reads in all the configuration sources. Remember: Spring Framework is a dependency management framework. It needs to know how your various objects are constructed, their lifecycles (constructors, `InitializingBean#afterPropertiesSet`,`@PostConstruct`, `DisposableBean#destroy`, `@PreDestroy`), etc. So it reads the various configuration files from all the `@Configuration`-annotated classes in your application through component scanning, where Spring discovers classes annotated with `@Component`. This component scanning also discovers classes annotated with annotations that have the `@Component` annotation on them, like `@Service`, `@Repository`, @Controller`, and `@RestController`. It also reads in configuration from Spring's classic XML configuration format. (I don't use the XML format and haven't seen it in the wild in over half a decade, but _still_...).

=== `BeanFactory` creation of `BeanDefinition`  instances
At this point, Spring turns all the various inputs into a metamodel representation of your objects, a `BeanFactory` full of `BeanDefinition` instances. These `BeanDefinition` instances describe the objects, wiring, and more. They represent the constructors, annotations, properties to be injected, setters, etc.  The `BeanDefinition` instances describe everything required to describe an object and get to a valid state so that it may be given to other objects and generally start doing work.

Notably, at this phase, there are no live-fire beans. Nothing is opening ports and sockets, doing disk IO, etc. This phase in the `BeanFactory` does not involve any business logic.

=== Bean Creation

Spring will take all the `BeanDefinition` instances and create actual, live-fire beans. Spring will call constructors, invoke lifecycle methods, etc. After this phase, you'll have an application ready to serve production traffic. This is _good_ (TM). We like production, don't we?

Spring Boot 3 introduces a new phase, at compile time, to support AOT.

== Enter GraalVm

https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] is a drop-in replacement for OpenJDK. It _is_ OpenJDK, largely. It has a few extra utilities: notably, a polyglot VM, a native image compiler, and a replacement  HotSpot replacement for the JIT (just-in-time) compiler. We could spend all day on these extra features, but let's focus on the `native-image` compiler. Henceforth, when I say "GraalVM," I specifically refer to the `native-image` compiler.

== You Gotta Start Somewhere

To start, as always, we'll go to the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initialzr (start.spring.io)]. Choose Spring Boot 3.0 or later from the Spring Initializr. I'm using Spring Boot 3, Apache Maven, and Java 17. Java 17 is the new baseline for Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3. I'm also using GraalVM 22.3. If you're using the fabulous https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN utility], then you can do the following to get the same version of GraalVM that I have on my computer as of this writing (late 2022):

[source, shell]
----
sdk install java 22.3.r17-grl
----

I've also added a few dependencies. We won't touch on these dependencies in any great length, but they'll help us to demonstrate a few concepts, so I've added them.

* Web (`org.springframework.boot` : `spring-boot-starter-web`)
* Actuator (`org.springframework.boot` : `spring-boot-starter-actuator`)
* Spring Data JDBC (`org.springframework.boot` : `spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc`)
* H2 (`com.h2database` : `h2`)

And of course, I've got a standard Spring Boot entry class.

[source,java]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/AotApplication.java[]
----

I won't add anything to this class. Instead, as we introduce new concepts, I'll create new `@Configuration`-annotated classes in sub-packages. We won't revisit this class.

Let's look at our first example of the new AOT engine in practice. This trivial and fairly typical application works with a database and surfaces an HTTP endpoint like any other trivial Spring Boot application. But, of course, you have seen this before.

[source,java]
-----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/basics/BasicsConfiguration.java[]
-----
<1> look ma, no Lombok!
<2> this is using Spring Data JDBC, and you can too!

You'll need some SQL schema, so add `src/main/resources/schema.sql` for our SQL interactions; so let's have Spring Boot create it for us on startup:

[source,sql]
----
include::{root}/src/main/resources/schema.sql[]
----

Run the main class in your IDE or on the command line in the usual ways:

[source,java]
----
mvn -DskipTests spring-boot:run
----

You should see some output on the console. It works. Hurray. Moving on, let's turn it into a native image, thusly:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -Pnative -DskipTests native:compile
----

That'll take a minute to finish, so now's a good time to pour a cup of coffee or tea. Maybe do a crossword puzzle. Reflect on your poor life choices to get to this point where your JVM applications take around a minute to compile. It's a bit dispiriting. But always remember: good things come to those who wait!

You'll find the compiled binary in the `target` directory, named `aot`. Run it, and you'll see it starts up in no time at all. Like a lightbulb! And, the best part is that it takes very little memory. Of course, there are different ways to measure memory, but looking at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_set_size[_resident set size_] is informative. Here's a script I use to measure this stuff called `rss.sh`:


[source,shell]
-----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
PID=${1}
RSS=`ps -o rss ${PID} | tail -n1`
RSS=`bc <<< "scale=1; ${RSS}/1024"`
echo "${PID}: ${RSS}M"
-----

It captures the RSS for a given process identifier, scales it to make it easier to parse, then prints it out. So, for example, you can find the process identifier (PID) for the Spring Boot application in the console towards the top of the application's output.

image::images/pid.png[]

Take it and then pass it as the argument for `rss.sh`, like this:

[source,shell]
-----
./rss.sh <PID>
-----

On my 2021 M1 MacBook Pro, I tend to get numbers just south of 100MB. Not bad!   How much RAM is your current JVM application taking? I'd be pleasantly surprised if it were a gigabyte or less! Imagine being able to deploy the same application for 1/10th of the memory footprint!

== The Spring component model

So, we know the basic stuff's working. Spring's got a rich, dynamic, multifaceted component model that can do amazing things. So, let's look at some examples demonstrating a few interesting aspects of the Spring programming model, old and new(-ish). I hope, but don't know, that a lot of this will rehash old stuff for many of you. So, feel free to skim this section and see if anything new in the headers strikes you as interesting. It's here because I wanted to be thorough and view the rich Spring component model through the prism of the new Spring AOT engine.


=== See How They Run

You can compile and run all the code in the usual way as a GraalVM native image:

[source,shell]
----
mvn -DskipTests native:compile && ./target/aot
----

Run the application, and you should see all the output from the previous examples, as expected. The best part? It'll have started in no time and be a far sight smaller as a binary and a process occupying RAM. You can use the `rss.sh` script we introduced to measure the process' RSS.

=== Event Listeners

Did you know that Spring has an event bus that you can use to publish and receive events in one component or another? Any component can fire an event (or more) and listen to and consume these events. There are two ways to consume events: with a bean of type `ApplicationListener<ApplicationEvent>`, or with the `@EventListener` annotation.

Here's a simple example.

[source,java]
-----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/events/EventsConfiguration.java[]
-----
<1> this is the first more traditional approach: a bean of type `ApplicationListener<T extends ApplicationEvent>`.
<2> this is the newer style, which frees your code of any explicit dependencies on the Spring framework

This example listens for two unrelated events. Although there is no significance to these events for our example, they demonstrate different ways of consuming Spring application events.

* `WebServerInitializedEvent` tells when the embedded web server has finished initializing.
* The `ApplicationReadyEvent` gets called as late as possible, right before the application handles traffic.

These are just a few of the events that Spring and Spring Boot emit as part of the lifecycle of an application. There are other events for all sorts of stuff, including Spring Security authentication, Actuator, Spring lifecycle, and more.

=== A Reusable Recipe for Object Creation

Sometimes objects require finessing and customization. Sometimes, creating an object becomes more complicated than just a simple constructor. Therefore, isolating this construction logic in a single place is helpful because it is reusable. There are at least two patterns that describe this sort of parameterized construction beside a constructor:

* the fluid builder pattern
* the factory pattern

There's nothing Spring can do to support the first pattern: that's very much up to each implementor how their types reflect the object creation patterns particular to their API. However, the Spring Framework `FactoryBean<T>` supports the second pattern. When you register a class of type `FactoryBean<T>` in the Spring context, it is the _product_ (an instance of type `T`) of that `FactoryBean<T>`, not the `FactoryBean<T>` itself, that is registered in the application context and made available for injection. In other words, you can't inject a reference to `FactoryBean<Foo>`, only `Foo`.

Let's look at its use in a trivial example:

[source,java]
-----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/factorybeans/FactoryBeansConfiguration.java[]
-----
<1> the `AnimalFactoryBean` produces an object of type `Animal`. But which? It depends on the parameters fed into the `FactoryBean`.
<2> the client code injects the `Animal`, ignorant of the construction logic.

=== Scopes

Beans in Spring have a lifecycle governing a given object's lifetime. Unless you specify something precisely, the default scope is `singleton`. Here are some of the more commonly used scopes.

* `singleton` - Spring creates a bean when the application starts up and destroys it when it shuts down. A bean defined in this way is _global_ - all clients of the bean will see the same state. So take care to handle concurrent access to this state in the same way you would any multithreaded access.
* `session` - a bean is created anew for each new HTTP Session. Each user with an HTTP session will have their instance of the bean. Changes won't be visible to other clients.
* `web` - each new HTTP request gets a new bean instance.
* `thread` - beans are unique to each thread. Sort of like a `ThreadLocal`.

This mechanism is pluggable, too, so implementors may also provide their scopes. Spring does this across the portfolio in projects like Spring Web Flow and Spring Batch. You'll also see it in third-party projects like the Flowable workflow engine.

[source,sql]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/scopes/ScopesConfiguration.java[]
----
<1> this bean is a `request` scoped, so it'll be created anew for each incoming HTTP request.
<2> this request-scoped bean should be different across different HTTP requests but the same for successive accesses during the same HTTP request.
<3> Spring is giving us a proxy, which won't result in an actual instance until the bean starts its lifecycle, bound to whatever externalities govern them.

Compile the application and visit  `http://localhost:8080/scopes/context` in your browser a few times. You should see that the `UUID` differs in each HTTP request.

=== Qualifiers

Qualifiers are conceptually very simple: given two types with the same interface, how does Spring choose which to inject in a given place? The answer is that we _qualify_ the bean we'd like.

Suppose we're trying to build two applications with competing mobile phone marketplace implementations, like the Apple AppStore and Android's Play store.

We might model them with an interface, which we're calling `MobileMarketplace`. In this example, we have two implementations of that interface, and we've used the `@Qualifier` annotation on both the bean itself and the place where the Spring injects it. As long as the `String` `value` in the annotation matches, Spring will inject the correct instance.  This mechanism goes even further:  you can put `@Qualifier` on your custom annotation and then use that annotation instead of `@Qualifier` directly on the various implementations. This practice helps you enforce a ubiquitous language, making your code's domain more approachable.

Let's look at an example:

[source,java]
-----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/qualifiers/QualifiersConfiguration.java[]
-----
<1> this bean uses the `android` implementation
<2> this bean uses the `apple` implementation
<3> can't decide? Just inject a `Map<String,T>`, where `T` is the type you're looking for. Spring will provide a map of bean names to bean instances.
<4> we create a meta-annotation.
<5> we implement the interface

I love that I can directly define a bean's qualifier using the `@Qualifier` annotation and inject it into a particular site using the meta-annotation. Or vice versa, or both. Spring doesn't care. _It just works_.

Compile and run the code to the correct instances printed out.

=== Configuration Properties

image::images/environment.gif[]

Spring Framework provides the `Environment` abstraction, mapping between a `String` key and a `String` value. In addition, there is a strategy interface (`PropertyResolver`) for resolving these properties. Spring Boot can then take values in the `Environment` and map them to objects via setters or their constructors. Here's an example:

[source,java]
-----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/properties/PropertiesConfiguration.java[]
-----
<1> Here, we're injecting a Java object called `DemoProperties`, to which properties starting with `bootiful` are bound
<2> the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation wires Spring to inject properties onto an instance of `DemoProperties`.

Compile and run the code to see the values reflected in the output.

== Detecting that you're in a Native Image

Sometimes hopefully not often! - you'll want to know when your code runs in a native image context. Knowing when your application is running is helpful because, as good as Spring's AOT engine is, we can't make it work perfectly in every situation, short of reviewing every line of code written. Some oddities arise from working in a GraalVM native image, and it's essential to be aware of those.

There is one helpful System property that you can use here: `org.graalvm.native image.imagecode`.  We've encapsulated that check-in a method in Spring Framework: `NativeDetector.inNativeImage()`. So here it is in action.

[source,java]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/detection/DetectionConfiguration.java[]
----

Run it on the JRE, and it'll return `false`. Run it in a GraalVM native image, and it'll return `true`.

My first instinct when I learned about that property was to wrap it in a `Condition` object and then use `@Conditional` to call that `Condition`, and thus make beans available in the Spring `BeanFactory` _conditionally_.

I tried it, and it didn't work.

Recall our discussion around the _phases_ of a Spring Boot application. It starts up, _ingests_ all the configuration, then creates a metamodel representation of the beans (`BeanDefinition` instances). Finally, Spring creates all the beans out of those `BeanDefinition` instances.

In an AOT application intended for GraalVM native image compilation, Spring Framework introduces a new phase during the compilation of the code. In this new phase, the Spring Boot build plugin creates a `BeanFactory` with populated `BeanDefinition` instances and stops there. Spring has a few new interfaces that are created and given a chance to inspect this `BeanFactory`, contributing whatever extra metadata is required to compile the beans in a GraalVM native image properly.

These interfaces also generate _new_, optimized code to recreate the state of the `BeanFactory` and skip the ingest phase. This new code and the contributed metadata are ultimately sent into the GraalVM native image compiler for compilation into a native image.

Spring only includes the beans in the final build present in the `BeanFactory` at compile time. So, if you have a bean that wasn't created at compile time because some `@Conditional` test evaluated to `false`, or because some profile wasn't active, it won't be there in the native image. To that end, I'd strongly urge you to avoid using profiles if you intend to create a GraalVM native image. There are some `@Conditional` annotations you should avoid, too.

Spring's AOT engine evaluates the `@Conditional` annotations at compile time. Some invariant conditions are the same at compilation time and runtime - like `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnProperty`. They work just fine in the native world: the classes present at compile time are, by definition, the classes present at runtime. However, some conditions depend on ambient state, like whether you're running in a Kubernetes cluster (`@ConditionalOnCloudPlatform(platform=CloudPlatform.Kubernetes)`). Avoid these conditions unless you plan on compiling your code in a Kubernetes cluster.

== Application Migration

So far, everything works well out of the box. It is our goal that the vast majority of Spring applications have a path to upgrade to Spring Boot 3 and then enjoy the benefits of native image compilation. But, sometimes things don't work as expected. Sometimes, they don't work because one of the libraries on the classpath or indeed your code has done something to run afoul of the cases as mentioned earlier where you'll need to furnish configuration `.json` files.

The error messages are pretty helpful, but the cycle time of compiling and running the application, getting a compiler error, making a change, then repeating can be tedious, especially when 30 seconds or longer compile times and long reset cycles are involved!

once you know what configuration your application will need, it's pretty straightforward to craft the hints using the Java API. The trouble is how do you figure out what hints are required? It can be tortuous to have an idea, make the change, then wait a minute (or more!) to find out if that worked and - if not - what the next error is. The reset cycle is what scares people. Mercifully, there are some pretty good ways to get a lot of this work done for you: running in AOT mode on the JRE, and running the GraalVM Java agent.

=== Run the AOT Code on the JRE

The first thing you might do is run the code in AOT mode. If you think about it,   Spring Boot applications now have three different runtime destinations:

 * traditional Spring Boot running on the JRE. This is the default and works exactly as it always has. Do nothing different and you'll get this behavior.
 * code generated during the AOT phase of compilation, also run on the JRE
 * code generated during the AOT phase of compilation, running in a GraalVM native image.


You get slightly more optimized performance when running AOT code on the JRE. You get considerably more performance when running the AOT code in a GraalVM native image.  That second option - running AOT code on the JRE - is awesome because it lets you preview what's going to get fed into the GraalVM native image compiler, and it is more performant than the traditional behavior.


You can generate the AOT code, without doing a full GraalVM reset:

[source,shell]
----
mvn clean compile spring-boot:process-aot package
----

This will transform your Spring application, and generate GraalVm native image hints, in the `target/spring-aot` directory of your application. You can inspect that directory to see which GraalVM native image hints were generated (under the `target` directory) and to see what code was generated (under the `sources` directory).

You can  run the AOT optimized and generated code on the JRE by using the  `-DspringAot=true` switch. Thus:

[source,shell]
----
java -DspringAot=true -jar aot-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

You can configure the Spring Boot build plugin to run with that property, too:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <springAot>true</springAot>
        </systemPropertyVariables>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Then, run it in the usual way, but with AOT enabled by defualt:

[source,shell]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----

The AOT mode is great because it's much faster than doing a full GraalVM native image compilation and run. You'll find that, because the AOT mode generates more efficient code that cuts out a lot of the extra `BeanDefinition`s that might otherwise hang around, the resulting application can be slightly more efficient even just running on the JRE.

That said, running in the AOT mode is only  useful if you're trying to sift throught the generated files to confirm something is as it should be. It doens't help you if you don't yet know what should be in the first place. This part can be tricky, because - faced with a huge classpath full of libraries - it can de difficult to know what configuration is required  at all, let alonee what should be provided out of the box or what you'll have to provide.

=== Run the Java Agent


You can run the program, and the agent alongside it, and get the agent to tell you what things were reflected on, serialized, proxied, etc., by running the app on the JVM with `-Dagent=true` when running the app with maven (try `mvn spring-boot:run`). This will dump out config files in the `target/native/agent-output` directory. You can inspect those and then use those to tell you what could you'll need to contribute hints for. The Java agent dumps out _everything_, including some things that Spring's AOT engine will do automatically for you and thus you don't need to reproduce. I'd start with all the mentions of types across the various configuration files that are in the same packages as code in your application. That way you won't specify hints that Spring might've already done for you.

Importantly: it'll also print out all the stuff that's random, and changes from one run to another. YOu can usually identify these as the classes with dollar signs in them or UUID-like names. Ignore those until the very end. They're probably not interesting.


Configure the Spring Boot Maven build plugin to contribute a JVM argument:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <jvmArguments>
            -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=target/native-image
        </jvmArguments>
        <!--....-->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

Then run it thusly:

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw -DskipTests clean package spring-boot:run
----

Inspect the `target/native-image/` directory. You'll find that the Java agent has written out a `reflect-config.json` file that tells us something is going to reflect upon the `Person` type at runtime. We can also see that there is an entry for the `data.csv` file in the `resource-config.json` file.

It's important that you exhaust as many code paths as possible whiel running the Java agent. Perhaps you could run it while running your tests?  We want to make sure that you capture every scenario that may require configuration. Be sure to through all the `.json` configuration files and note every instance where one of the types we've created - like `Person` -  is present.

At this point, I'd disable the Java agent, commenting it out in the Maven `pom.xml`. It's served  its purpose for now. Move the `native-image` directory aside so it doesn't get deleted later. If you try to compile and run the application   as a GraalVM native image, then you're going to want to consult these files.


=== Soft-touch Refactorings to Enable AOT

Let's look a bare bones example that could run afoul of GraalVM's native image compilation but for our interventions. Here's the completed program:

[source,java]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/migrations/MigrationsConfiguration.java[]
----
<1> this program simply reads in CSV data (in the least production-worthy  way possible!) and maps the rows into `Person` instances
<2> we know that the Jackson JSON marshalling library is going to need to reflect on those `Person` instances, so we've used Spring's convenient `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` annotation to tell Spring to proactively register the GraalVM hints required to support that. This annotation must be on or in a Spring component or `@Configuration` class.
<3> we  know that this program will need to read the `.csv` file from the `.jar`, which is a resource. This will be a problem for GraalVm unless we contribute some hints. We use the `@ImportRuntimeHints` annotation to tell Spring to involve a class of type `RuntimeHintsRegistrar` in the compilation process so that we can programatically contribute those hints.
<4> we _could_, as an alternative to using the `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` annotation, have simply contributed a hint for reflective access for that type here, too.

You'll need to create a file with sample data called `src/main/resources/data.csv`. Here's the one I put in the code:

[source,properties]
----
include::{root}/src/main/resources/data.csv[]
----

Now, for our example to work - or, rather, _not_ work, you'll need to comment out the lines where we use the `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` and `@ImportRuntimeHints` annotations. Then, run and compile the program. You should see it fail when you start it up as a GraalVM native image.

The first error I got was related to being unable to load the `csv` file. So, restore the `@ImportRuntimeHints` annotation. Compile and run that. You'll get an error about serializing the `Person`. Restore the line with `@RegisterReflectionForBinding` and everything should work.

Compile and run the program, and you should see the `Person` records printed on the console.

This program starts up and uses the Jackson JSON marshalling library  directly to print out JSON representations of some objects. This is a bit of a contrived example: when was the last time you used Jackson to print out some objecets and _that's all_?   If we had returned the `Person` type from a Spring `@Controller`, then Spring would automatically know to register hints for it. Spring would still need the hint for the `.csv` file, however.

== Processing the Bean Factory

We've talked about the `BeanFactory`. It's basically a container, an aggregation, of all the beans in your application. In earlier sections, we saw that the beans in the `BeanFactory` are created as `BeanDefinition` instances. These `BeanDefinition`s are the metamodel representation of your object graph. They describe all the dependencies, constructors, annotations, fields, etc., related to your bean instances.

Spring makes it trivial to act on that collection of `BeanDefinition` instances through callback interfaces that are evaluated at compile time (AOT) and runtime (JRE). The `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` is a callback interface that lets us have access to the `BeanFactory` and to manipulate the `BeanDefinition` instances. We can register new ones, update existing ones, or even remove them in this interface and in other, more specific subclasses of this interface. The `BeanFactory` is not fixed at this point. Various Spring projects use this fact to great effect. Before we turned the Spring Cloud project into an umbrella project that included a ton of different libraries to make working with microservices easier, its sole function was to make it easy for Spring Boot applications deployed to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Cloud Foundry or Heroku to connect to managed infrastructure like a database or a message queue. It did this by analyzing the `BeanFactory`, identifying infrastructure-related beans like `javax.sql.DataSource`, and then replacing them with a new bean of an identical interface, but with a connection pointing to the managed infrastructure identified by environment variables in the process space of the running application. So, you write an application using a `DataSource` talking to an embedded H2 instance on your local machine, but when you deploy it, this `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` identifies connection strings in environment variables in the process space for the application and uses that to create a proper `DataSource` talking to that managed infrastructure, presumably on another host and port. And this was all transparent to the user, which is what we want.

The `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` is a great place to see _everything_ in the `BeanFactory` all in one place when the application starts up.

the `BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor` is a new interface that is sort of a peer t the `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`. It runs at compile time, and you have basically the same contract: you can choose to contribute hints (or even do code-generation) while analyzing the `BeanDefinition`s in the application.

It's important that you work only in terms of the `BeanDefinition` instances and bean names, in both these interfaces. Remember, at this point, Spring hasn't created any of the eans. So, while you'll be able to call `BeanFactory#getBean(String)`, it'll force  Spring to eagerly initialize the object, calling the constructor and the methods and so on before the bean is ready. Don't do this - it'll really screw things up!


Let's look at a trivial example. We'll write a `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` that analyzes programmatically registers a new `BeanDefinition` in the application context. Would you ever nee to do this? No. but it's hopefully illustrative. We'll use a subclass of `BeanFactoryPostProcessor` called `BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor`, which gives us a `BeanFactory` downcast to a specific subtype that supports programmatically registering new beans. The trouble is that this bean we'll register is going to require some reflection using the Jackson JSON API, so we'll need to also register a GraalVM hint for it using a `BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor` contribution.

<1> were going to work with the same bean both at compile time and at runtime. So, I've stashed a variable with the name of the bean here for access from both interfaces at both phases
<2> Note that the bean definitions here are registered with the `static` keyword. Spring will involve these beans very early in the lifecycle of the application context. It won't have any live fire beans except for these very early beans. So, we use `static` to avoid depending on anything from the `BeanFactory`. And don't force Spring to construct the `@Configuration` class containing the `@Bean` registration methods, too.
<3> the `Listener` is a trivia `ApplicationListener` that, when run, will iterate over a collection of dummy DTOs and print them out using Jackson for JSON serialization. This serialization involves reflection, for which we'll need to furnish hints.
<4> the first callback, the `ListenerBeanFactoryPostProcessor`, programmatically registers a new `BeanDefinition` of type `Listener` if a bean of the name we've specified in the variable doesn't already exist in the context. This object runs at runtime, in both the JRE and the AOT application. Here were changing, molding, the `BeanFactory`.
<5> when we compile the application using the AOT engine, intending to build a graalvm native image, Spring Boot will also run the the `ListenerBeeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor`, which - knowing that we'll eventually register a `Listener` bean - furnishes the requisite hints to make the JSON serialization of the `Product` records work.

These two interfaces work well together. They complement each other. The `BeanFactory` is the lowest level at which I'd write code. I don't want to write code in terms of the `BeanFactory` if i can avoid it. It is, as I said, the primordial ooze of your running application. Its the suggestion, the insinuation, the allusion to a valid working application. But it's not a working application. That comes only after those `BeanDefinition` instances are turned into valid objects. that comes next.

== Processing Beans

If the `BeanFactory` is too meta (no, not _that_ Meta!) for you, then you can still do interesting things at the next rung in the abstraction ladder, working with beans directly, both before they've been initialized and after they've been initialized.

Working on a bean by bean basis can be very powerful. If you want to work with actual, live-fire beans, you can use Spring's `BeanPostProcessor`. This interface puts you in a position to act on, to transform, objects before they're finally live and handling logic. this is great for infrastructure code, such as frameworks, where you need to note or retain or observe references to objects of a given shape. What shape? Well, anything, really! Objects that have a certain marker interface. Objects that have a certain annotation. Whatever you want, and whatever you could decide given reflection methods.  Let's look at an example that creates proxies for objects with an annotation, `@Logged`, logging out any method invocations on those beans.

I implement this proxy with Spring's `ProxyFactory`, which makes it trivial to use the _proxy_ design pattern. A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else  Spring uses proxies to handle things like declarative transaction management, auditing, security, logging, concurrency, etc. there a great way to _decorate_ an existing object with cross-cutting concerns, like starting and committing a transaction before and after a method invocation. Spring uses them all over the place, for things like `@Transactional`, `@Scheduled`, `@Async`, `@Authorized`, and countless more.

There are two types of proxies: CGLIB and JDK. Proxies make it trivial to create an object that implements an interface type of your choice and then forwards the actual work to a concrete instance of your choice.  JDK proxies are built with Java's https://www.baeldung.com/java-dynamic-proxies[`InvocationHandler`].  In the case of JDK proxies, the word `interface`  used in the description above is quite literally a Java `interface` type.

But what if the contract the surface area, the _interface_ of your class isn't a Java interface? What if it's a concrete class for which it makes little sense to extract out a separate Java interface? JDK proxies require an interface, and they were the only thing supported in Spring until Spring Framework 1.1.

NOTE: I can't be sure, but I suspect this is one of the reasons so much of the early literature for Spring Framework suggests using interfaces with Spring beans, and why you'd see things like `FooService` and `DefaultFooService` or `FooService` and `FooServiceImpl` or whatever. Nowadays that's an anti-pattern, and highly discouraged, _unless_ you actually plan to have more than one implementation of `FooService`. Avoid the knee-jerk reaction to create an interface for an object that has the same shape as the object. It only complicates things.

Spring supports concrete proxies, too, using https://github.com/cglib/cglib[CGLIB]. CGLIB is used to dynamically generate the code to subclass an existing type. The constraint, thus, is that the type be subclass-able. So, beware things like `final` and `sealed`.

Spring's concrete proxies are unique to Spring, but they're _everywhere_. You  use them every time you use a `@Configuration` class!

Naturally, creating a dynamic subclass of a given type, registering it in the `ClassLoader` and then swapping out your instance for the instance that delegates to yours implies a lot of funny business that we'll need to account for everything at compile time in a GraalVM native image context.

=== Proxies

Mercifully, Spring can do a lot of this for us. Let's take a look at an example.

Let's look at a simple proxy example the logs information whenever somebody invokes a method annotated called `@Logged`, which we'll create. The annotation is nice because it's decorative. We're layering capabilities onto this method, without complicating the implementation of the business logic.

[source,java]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/bpp/proxies/ProxiesConfiguration.java[]
----
<1> as usual, we'll try things out when the application starts up
<2> we're going to create this proxy in a subclass of `BeanPostProcessor` called `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`. Spring's AOT engine invokes the `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor#determineBeanType` to determine what type the bean should be. Spring's AOT engine uses that information to determine what proxies to build. When the application starts up completely, Spring will also invoke `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor#postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName)`, giving you a chance to inspect a given bean and -
<3> we need to both build a proxy and determine what the resulting class of that proxy at various phases in the lifecycle of the `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`. So, we'll return the builder, an instance of `ProxyFactory`, and either use it to determine the expected proxy's class type, or use it to actually create the final proxy object.
<4> setting `proxyTargetClass` to `true` and specifying a `targetClass` results in a CGLIB proxy. Otherwise, the expectation is that you're only proxying interfaces.
<5>   `BeanPostProcessor` implementations visit every bean in the `BeanFactory`, so we must take care to only act on those with the annotation present. Tht logic is encoded in this `matches` method, which looks for all types annotated with, or types with methods annotated with, the `@Logged` annotation.
<6> the `SmartInstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor#determineBeanType` method does almost all the work of creating a proxy, but stops short of actually creating the proxy. We're only interested in knowing what the class would be _if_ we did create a proxy. This then gets fed into the AOT engine.
<7> here's where the rubber meets the road and Spring actually creates a CGLIB proxy at runtime. This works just fine as Spring's already registered the requisite hints with GraalVM during compilation.

In this example, we're using the cohesive design of Spring's AOT engine to transparently create proxies that _just work_. If we on the Spring team have done our job right, and you've written your code to leverage the right interfaces, then you can trust Spring to do the right thing for CGLIB proxies.

Compile and run the application and you should see informatin logged when we invoke the method in the `ApplicationListener`.

=== Code Generation

Suppose you're using a library and it in turn is using `InvocationHandler`, outside of Spring's purview? You'll need to furnish the appropriate hints for GraalVM knows what to do there. You might also have stuff you want to do at runtime that requires upfront, compile-time processing. Code-generation is one of the most powerful dimensions of Spring's AOT engine. We use it all over the place in Spring Framework 6!  You can both furnish configuration and generate code at compile with implementations of the AOT equivalent to `BeanPostProcessor`, the  `BeanRegistrationAotProcessor`.

Let's look at a simple example. This time we'll revisit the code generation, but go even further. We're going to register a brand new bean during compilation, overwriting one that's already present, so that we can capture compile-time information and put it in the endpoint. This Actuator endpoint, the `CompilationEndpoint` is suitably trivial as to be understandable in a quick introduction like this one. This new `CompilationEndpoint` will capture information about the ambient state of the build _at compile-time_, like the time and directory in which the code was compiled.

[source,java]
----
include::{source}/com/example/aot/bpp/code/CompilationEndpointConfiguration.java[]
----
<1> we're going to register an empty, no-op version of the `CompilationEndpoint` here
<2> we will post-process the bean at compile time using an implementation of a `BeanRegistrationAotProcessor`
<3> as usual, we'll test things out when the application starts up.
<4> Have you ever seen how to register a Spring Boot Actuator endpoint? Well, now you have. It's easy. Endpoints are supposed to be written in such a way that they could work agnostic to whichever rendering mechanism - HTTP, JMX, etc. - you might use. This endpoint exports some key-value pairs in a `Map<String, Object>` returned from the `compilation()` read operation. Note that we have _two_ constructors: one for the no-op case, and another for information about the build, like the time and directory of the compilation.
<5> Like the `BeanPostProcessor`, `BeanRegistrationAotProcessor` implementations work on a bean-by-bean basis, getting a chance to inspect and change them. We again use the Java Poet abstraction to register new code, a method named `postProcessCompilationEndpoint`, which takes an instance of type `RegisteredBean` and another instance of type `CompilationEndpoint`. The `RegisteredBean` allows us to inspect the reflective metadata associated with the bean, and of course the `CompilationEndpoint` is the bean we created earlier. If the user doesnt use Spring's AOT engine, then the bean we looked at earlier is the only bean they'll ever get. If they do use the AOT engine, however, then this method will return a _new_ `CompilationEndpoint`, initialized with values during compilation.
<6> the key bit starts here: we use Java Poet to create a new instance of `CompilationEndpoint` with real values initialized and captured during the AOT phase itself. Now _that's_ meta!


Compile the application and then wait a minute. Then run the application. You should see that the information about the compilation, which will have occcured a minute or more earlier, will be printed in the console.

You can see the output of what we've just done in the resulting generated Java code:

== Testing

testing is an incredibly important part of the story. The good news is, we've done a ton of work to make testing *just work* in a native image context. you can run a maven build or a Gradle build in native mode and you'll get two output artifacts: one for tests, one for the production code. Fair warning tho! This'll make the compilation take twice as long! That could be a few minutes.

lets look at some examples of tests:


```java
package com.example.aot.basics;

import org.junit.Jupiter.API.Assertions;
import org.junit.Jupiter.API.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

@SpringBootTest(properties = "spring.main.web-application-type=none")
class CustomerRepositoryTest {

    private final CustomerRepository repository;

    CustomerRepositoryTest(@Autowired CustomerRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Test
    void save() throws Exception {
        var saved = this.repository.save(new Customer(null, "Jürgen")) ;
        Assertions.assertNotNull(saved.id() );
    }
}
```
- run with the `nativeTest` Maven profile, e.g.:  `mvn  -PnativeTest,native clean package  && ./target/aot      `
- there's a new binary in the `target` directory called `native-tests`
- show how you can write tests things like the predicates themselves with `RuntimeHintsPredicates`:

```java

class MigrationsConfigurationTest {

    @Test
    void hints() {
        var runtimeHints = new RuntimeHints();
        var registrar = new MigrationsConfiguration.MigrationsRuntimeHintsRegistrar();
        var classLoader = getClass().getClassLoader();
        registrar.registerHints(runtimeHints, classLoader);
        assertThat(RuntimeHintsPredicates.resource().forResource("data.csv")).accepts(runtimeHints);
    }
}
```

== a note on compile times

You know. I love GraalVM, but one thing that can be a real kick in the pants is the wait times. I get _why_ it's happening. It's not hard to understand. GraalVm does a _lot_ of work - doing a full analysis of our code and all the code on the classpath. it's no wonder that it takes as much memory and time as it does. And it has already improved _dramatically_ even since I first started using it in earnest less than three years ago. It's a marvelous piece of software. But those compile times are tedious. They interrupt my sense of flow. And it's almost a curse that they've improved as much as they have, because the compile times are now fast enough that you don't have time to go pour a cup of coffee or eat a cup of yogurt, but slow enough that you feel like you're being interrupted. Youre being kicked out of 'the zone. This reminds me of that classic XKCD cartoon, which I suspect referred to large C and C++ applications of the day. Java and Go and other more modern languages have mercifully quick compilation times. In this one sense, it feels like graalvm has taken us a step backwards. I kick off a compile and my mind wanders. i've been doing so many of these that now I'm starting to hear elevator music when I do a compile! Don't you hear elevator music? So I filed an issue. I want everyone else to hear elevator music, too. So I asked. It doesn't hurt to ask. I went to the official graalvm project and I asked. it seemed to resonate with people. one person even suggested which elevator music we should use. I love it! And, fabian nipehaus - of the official graalvm team at oracle, a PhD - a DOCTOR, like Drs. Seus, Syer, Strange, Who, and Subramaniam - responded with a promising prototype. I love this prototype. He even had it print out some ASCII art so that people would have something to look at. i was sad, to say the least, to see that he didn't think this would be accepted, if for no other reason than because of the copyrighted music. Dang! oh well. Hope _springs_ eternal.

== Conclusion

We've come a long way! When I started covering Spring Native (the predecessor to what would eventually become Spring Framework 6's AOT engine) in 2020, a build took _10 minutes_ and only worked for the smallest and most specific scenarios. Now, here we are in 2022 and I can all but effortlessly get a Spring app working in a GraalVM native image context in less than a minute.
- the performance and memory usage implications are hard to ignore, and I think the inertia required to make the move to AOT will be become easier and easier to obtain in the next days, weeks, months and years, as the community embraces Spring's newfound AOT support.
- I hope this video makes it easier for everyone, application and framework developers alike, to leverage spring boot 3 and spring framework 6.
- obviously, you won't be starved for examples if you need guidance in implementing this stuff in your own code.
- Just look for pointers to types like `RuntimeHintsRegistrar`, `BeanRegistrationAotProcessor`, and `BeanFactoryInitializationAotProcessor` in the Spring Boot codebase! And those don't even begin to cover the implementations provided by the projects themselves, like Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Spring Shell, Spring Integration, and Spring Batch.
- We've only just begun to scratch the surface here, my friends.
- Now, bear in mind that things may change in relatively minor ways in the coming weeks and months leading to spring boot 3 later this year, but conceptually, what you've seen here today is the future, and it's here today.
